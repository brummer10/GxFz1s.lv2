###### BUILD DEPENDENCYâ€™S 

the following packages are needed to build GxFz1s:

- libc6-dev
- libgtk2.0-dev
- libstdc++6-dev
- lv2-dev

note that those packages could have different, but similar names 
on different distributions. There is no configure script, 
make will simply fail when one of those packages isn't found.

will install into ~/.lv2

$ sudo make install
